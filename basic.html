                    <h2>Gaining / losing weight</h2>
                    <center>
                        <p>So how does weight loss and weight gaining work. How can we control what we look like? What
                            weight gaining and weight loss is all decided on by how much calories we eat in a day. If we
                            eat more calories than we need to maintain we store those calories as fat. If we eat less
                            calories than the amount we need to maintain we will lose weight, we will end up burning
                            either fat or muscle to help maintain.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So how can we use this to our advantage? We can control how much calories we eat in a day to
                            decide on what to look like. If we wanted to lose a couple pounds in a month we could simply
                            limit our daily consumtion by anywhere 300-500 calories below our maintainance calorie
                            intake. This would lead us to start burning off weight and allowing us to start losing
                            weight. The same is true if we want to gain weight
                            we would simply need to increase our calories by 300-500 above our daily maintainance
                            calorie intake.

                    <h2>Gaining muscle</h2>
                    <center>
                        <p>Muscles allow us to do everything in life it helps us to move it helps us to react. We use
                            muscles every day of our lives, from texting to eating. We use our muscles and our muscle
                            memory to help us do everything.
                            <br><br>
                            So how can we build or gain more muscle? We build muscle by using our muscles and breaking
                            them down. When we use muscle we are actually breaking down that muscle and ripping fibers,
                            this may seem bad but its not. By ripping the muscle fibers we actually encourage the muscle
                            to grow and become stronger. By consuming protein in our foods we are providing the muscle
                            with fuel to grow more. The more we break the muscle down the more it will grow. Eating a
                            good amount of protein in our diets and exercising our body allows us to grow our muscles
                            more.

                    <h2>Basics of dieting</h2>
                    <center>
                        <p>Many common beliefs is that once we start dieting we can never have the food we love anymore.
                            However that is not always the case. Sure to get to peak fitness, and to look like the best
                            body builders you would need to train a lot and eat the healthiest you can. However if
                            you're simply wanting to lose weight or gain weight its not all that hard. You won't have to
                            cut too much out of your diet to achieve that.
                            <br><br>
                            To lose or gain weight all you need to do is track how much calories your body need to
                            maintain your current body weight, and either add or subtract 300-500 calories per day. Once
                            you do so you should aim to eat close to that calorie intake. You can change how much you
                            eat per day depending on your goals.
